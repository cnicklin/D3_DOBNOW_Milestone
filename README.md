## DOB NOW: Build Milestones

The New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) DOB NOW Build Milestones application displays basic details for selected DOB NOW Build filings on an interactive map of New York City. Each filing is represented as a point on the map, and clicking the point or the item on the list below brings you to a profile page that shows major milestone dates for that filing. The application is updated daily with the latest filings for Antenna, Curb Cut, Fence, Plumbing, Scaffold, Sidewalk Shed, Sign, Sprinkler, and Standpipe filings in DOB NOW.

## Data Source

Data flows from the BI tool to GitHub public hold. This is a daily automated process. It creates results in 2 formats: JSON (for search) and CSV (for map imaging).

## Data Definitions
Definitions for elements on the Profile Page are listed below, but can also be viewed by hovering over the field name on the webpage.

### Profile Page

| Field Name | Definition |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Job Number | The unique ID number assigned when the applicant submits the filing to the Department of Buildings. |
| BIN Number | The Building Identification Number assigned by the Department of City Planning. |
| Work Type | The type of work described in this filing. It could include plumbing, sprinkler, construction fence, or another type of work. |
| Job Type | This indicates the extent of the work being done. NB means a new building is being built. A1 means that extensive alterations will be done resulting in a change of building occupancy. A2 means that alterations will be done but will not result in a change of building occupancy. A3 indicates that minor alterations will be done. |
| Professional Certification | Yes indicates that the applicant is certifying that the work being performed complies with all applicable laws and codes. This job will then skip review by a plan examiner. |
| Filing Status | The current status of the filing. A definition for each of the values for Filing Status can be found on our [Status Glossary](https://github.com/cnicklin/D3_DOBNOW_Milestone/blob/gh-pages/Statuses.md). |
| Number of Resubmissions | During review, the Department of Buildings may return a filing to the applicant multiple times because the information is incomplete, because it needs correction, or another reason. This indicates the total number of times the filing was resubmitted, and does not include the initial submission. |
| Job Description | The general description of the work being applied for. This field is free text, and is filled out by the applicant. |

| First Objection | The date that the filing was first returned to the applicant with objections.

| QA Admin Assigned | The date that the filing was assigned to a QA Admin. |
| Initial QA Failed | The first date that the filing was returned to the applicant because it was incomplete or needed correction. A filing can fail QA multiple times, or it may be approved on the first review and skip this milestone date. |

| Initial Permit Issued | The first date that a permit was issued. Multiple permits can be issued for a job filing. |
| Latest Permit Expiration | The expiration date for the most recent permit. Multiple permits can be issued for a job filing. |
| Job Signed Off | The date that the Department of Buildings acknowledged that the work is complete. |

### Milestone Timelines

To facilitate the design and layout of the Milestone Timeline in the Job Filing page, the following timelines were created. This reduces confusion that may be caused when a simpler timeline skips over a date, such as when a standard plan exam job never receives an objection.

Standard Plan Exam Timelines
<ol>
    <li>Standard Plan Exam with no objections: Initial Filing > CPE Assigned > CPE Action > PE Assigned > Plan Approved > Initial Permit Issued > Latest Permit Expiration > Job Signed Off</li>
    <li>Standard Plan Exam where the filing received its first objection (Filing Status = "Objections" and Resubmissions = 0): Initial Filing > CPE Assigned > CPE Action > PE Assigned > First Objection > Latest Objection > Latest Resubmission > Plan Approved > Initial Permit Issued > Latest Permit Expiration > Job Signed Off</li>
    <li>Standard Plan Exam where the filing received another objection (Filing Status = "Objections" and Resubmissions > 0): Initial Filing > CPE Assigned > CPE Action > PE Assigned > First Objection > Latest Resubmission > Latest Objection > Plan Approved > Initial Permit Issued > Latest Permit Expiration > Job Signed Off</li>
    <li>Standard Plan Exam with objections that has been resubmitted (Filing Status does not equal "Objections" and Resubmissions > 0): Initial Filing > CPE Assigned > CPE Action > PE Assigned > First Objection > Latest Objection > Latest Resubmission > Plan Approved > Initial Permit Issued > Latest Permit Expiration > Job Signed Off</li>
</ol>

Professional Certification Timelines

    <li>Pro-Cert where the filing failed QA another time (Filing Status = "QA Failed" and Resubmissions > 0): Initial Filing > QA Supervisor Assigned > QA Admin Assigned > Initial QA Failed > Latest Resubmission > Latest QA Failed > Plan Approved > Initial Permit Issued > Latest Permit Expiration > Job Signed Off</li>
    <li>Pro-Cert with QA failures that has been resubmitted: Initial Filing > QA Supervisor Assigned > QA Admin Assigned > Initial QA Failed > Latest QA Failed > Latest Resubmission > Plan Approved > Initial Permit Issued > Latest Permit Expiration > Job Signed Off</li>
